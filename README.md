# 🚗 Car Hail Damage Repair  
Welcome to the **Car Hail Damage Repair** Project! This initiative leverages advanced image processing and machine learning to assess and repair hail damage on vehicles efficiently.  

---

## 📖 Overview  
Hail damage can be costly and frustrating for car owners, especially in hail-prone regions like the USA (based on personal experience). This project aims to streamline the damage assessment process, helping both customers and repair shops understand the extent of damage and suitable repair options using just a portable device.

## ✨ Key Features  
- **🌐 User-Friendly Web App:** Built with Flask, allowing users to easily upload images of damaged vehicles.  
- **🖼️ Smart Image Processing:** Utilizing OpenCV and Pillow for efficient damage detection and assessment.  
- **🤖 Machine Learning Insights:** Powered by TensorFlow, providing intelligent analysis of damage severity and potential repair solutions.  
- **📊 Data Handling:** Efficient image data processing with NumPy.  

---

## 🎯 Why It Matters  
Hail damage can significantly impact car aesthetics and value. This project offers:  
- **Precision:** Accurate damage detection using advanced image analysis.  
- **Speed:** Rapid processing and assessment.  
- **Convenience:** Easy-to-use web interface for quick uploads and reports.

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup  
1. **Clone the Repository:**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/prayag-verma/Car-Hail-Damage-Repair.git
cd Car-Hail-Damage-Repair
```  

2. **Create a Virtual Environment:**  
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```  

3. **Install Dependencies:**  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```  

4. **Run the Application:**  
```bash
flask run
```  
Visit `http://localhost:5000` to use the app.

## 📸 How It Works  
1. **Upload Image:** Users upload a photo of the hail-damaged area.  
2. **Damage Analysis:** The app uses image processing techniques to identify damage.  
3. **ML Insights:** TensorFlow model predicts damage severity and suggests repair options.  
4. **Report Generation:** A detailed report is provided for users and repair shops.  

---

## 🚀 4-Step Process  
1. **Place Device on the Damage Area.**  
2. **Enter the Make & Model of the Car.**  
3. **Initiate Scan Process:**  
   - 🔍 HailBot retrieves car material info and specs.  
   - 📏 Scans damaged area and calculates the required force.  
4. **Initiate Repair Process:**  
   - 🧲 Uses a suction cup to apply the needed force for repair.
