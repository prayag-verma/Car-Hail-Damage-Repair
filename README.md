# Car-Hail-Damage-Repair
Welcome to the Car Hail Damage Repair Project! This initiative harnesses the power of Python and its vast libraries to tackle the challenges of assessing and repairing hail damage on vehicles.

# Whatâ€™s Inside:
**User-Friendly Web App:** Built with Flask, our app allows users to easily upload images of damaged cars.
**Smart Image Processing:** Using OpenCV and Pillow, we analyze photos to identify and assess hail damage efficiently.
**Machine Learning Insights:** With TensorFlow, we provide intelligent analysis on the severity of the damage and suggest potential repair options.
**Data Handling Made Easy:** NumPy helps us manage and process the image data seamlessly.

# Why It Matters:
Hail damage can be frustrating and costly for car owners ate least in the USA(based on personla experience). This project aims to streamline the assessment process, making it easier for both customers and repair shops to understand the extent of the damage and the best ways to fix it with jsut a device that is very handy and portable.
